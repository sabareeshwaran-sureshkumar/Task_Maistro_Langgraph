# Task mAIstro

Managing tasks effectively is a universal challenge. Task mAIstro is an AI-powered task management agent that combines natural language processing with long-term memory to create a more intuitive and adaptive experience. This repo can be used to deploy Task mAIstro and interact with it through text or voice!

Key features:
* Natural conversation through text and / or voice to update or add tasks
* Adaptive learning of your management style and preferences
* Persistent memory of tasks, context, and preferences
* Flexible deployment options - local or hosted

5. Experiment with voice UX in `ntbk/audio_ux.ipynb`.

## Task mAIstro Application

### Architecture

Task mAIstro leverages [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) to maintain three memory types:

1. **ToDo List Memory**
   - Task descriptions and deadlines
   - Time estimates and status tracking
   - Actionable next steps

2. **User Profile Memory**
   - Personal preferences and context
   - Work/life patterns
   - Historical interactions

3. **Interaction Memory**
   - Task management style
   - Communication preferences
   - Organizational patterns

The schema for each memory type as well as the graph flow is defined in `task_maistro.py`. 
The graph flow is orchestrated by a central `task_maistro` node that:
- Chooses to update one of the three memories based on the user's input
- Uses tool calling with the [Trustcall library](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall) to update the chosen memory type

## Voice Interface

Task mAIstro supports voice interactions using:
- [OpenAI's Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text) for speech-to-text
- [ElevenLabs](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python) for text-to-speech

### Setup

1. Install FFmpeg (required for ElevenLabs):
```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

2. In `audio_ux.ipynb`, connect to your deployment using the URL endpoint:
- **Studio**: Found in Studio UI
- **CLI**: Printed to console (e.g., typically `http://localhost:8123`)
- **Cloud**: Available in the LangSmith Deployment page
